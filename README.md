### **Description**
Usermap is an extension for phpBB board versions 3.2.x and 3.3.x which adds a map with your users locations - and if you choose so, additional layers with
points of interest (POI) for your users - to the board. It is accessible through a link in the board's navigation header.  
To determine your users' locations Usermap uses the country and the postal code of the municipality a user lives in and looks up its coordinates primarily in
the database of *[geonames.org][]* which means that it is **mandatory** for you to register an account there. Without this account Usermap will not function!  
Since *[geonames.org][]* does not provide coordinates for every country in the world you can select Google Maps as an additional source and for all countries
even Google Maps does not provide postal code related coordinates you as your board's administrator can provide coordinates for a pair of country and postal
code by filling a table of phpbb's database. For more information please refer to the hints in the `ACP Settings` tab of the extension which provides some
links to important pages of the above mentioned providers.  
The POIs (which could be anything from landmarks to bikers' hangouts to sports arenas or whatever is important to your board) are stored in a table of
phpbb's database which the administrator can fill within the ACP or the users by right clicking into the map (if permissions assigned to them allow this).  

### **Important**
Since there are countries with one postal code (zip code) for more than one location and Geonames.org reflects this by providing all location names under this
postal code Usermap takes into account the content of phpBB's `phpbb_location` profile field to get a more detailed coordinate in those cases. **Therefore it
is important that you must not delete this profile field for the simple reason that you don't think it necessary!**

### **Installation**
It is strongly recomended that you use the zipped file package for installation since it always provides the latest version: *[download link][]*  
After downloading unzip the file and upload its content with a good ftp program (like FileZilla or WinSCP) to your board's `ext` folder where you should find
this directory structure afterwards:  
`/ext/mot/usermap`.  
In this subdirectory all subdirectories and files of the extension must be located.  
Logging into your board's ACP go to the `Customise` tab, find the `Usermap for phpbb` line and enable the extension. Afterwards you should see the
Usermap's five tabs under the `USER MAP` heading in the ACP's `Extensions` tab.

### **Usage**

#### *Users*
Users are effected by Usermap during registration, in the UCP and when they click the link to actually displaying the map itself. If you are asking yourself
now why users are effected during registration, it is quite simple: Usermap creates two new `Custom Profile Fields` which are by default displayed in the
registration process. The first one is a text field for input of the user's postal code and the second one is a dropdown field listing all countries of the
world for the user to easily select the country matching his or her location. If a user provides this data during registration Usermap will try to get a
coordinate from the enabled database(s) during the activation process and adds this user to the Usermap users table if it was successful.  
If a user chooses to not provide this information during registration he or she can do this anytime through the `Profile` tab in the UCP. As soon
as the user hits the enter key Usermap will try to get a coordinate as described above.  
PLEASE NOTE: Users must provide a valid pair of postal code and country, otherwise the lookup in the database will fail and the user is not listed in the
Usermap users table.  
  
Clicking the Usermap link in the header bar will open the map itself, its content is divided in three parts:
1.  Search Form  
In this part the user will find up to four tabs (depending on the permissions granted) indicating different search options.  
	+ The first option contains a search mask presenings a user's postal code prefixed by his/her country's two letter country code and a hyphen and followed by
	a dropdown field to select a range in kilometers which determines the radius around that location in which Usermap will look for other users after the `Submit`
	button was hit.  
	The result will be displayed in the next line(s) and if successful lists all users within the defined circle ordered by ascending distance. The user name
	is written in this user main group's colour and is a link to this user's profile which will open in a new browser tab or window depending on the settings
	of the browser.
	+ The second option presents an input field where a user can input another user's name (nickname), the usage of the wildcard "\*" is possible. After hitting
	the `Submit` button Usermap will search and list all user names which match the search pattern in a new section opening beneath the input field.
	All listed user names represent a link which will center and zoom the map on the respective user's location. If displaying the member overlay was switched
	off in the layer control element it will be switched on in order to prevent an empty map.
	+ The third option is and behaves similar to the second option, the difference is that a user can search for POIs by name.
	+ As a fourth option users can search for street addresses (or other stuff which Google Maps can provide). When a coordinate matching the given search term
	has been found this location is displayed on the map and marked with a simple marker. This location can then be used e.g. for creating a new POI by
	rightclicking on the marker.
2.  User Map  
This part displays the map itself. It contains two control elements, a scale control element in the upper left corner and a layer control element in the
upper right corner. The first one should be rather self-explanatory, the second one offers the possibility to switch between a road map (default), a
topographical map and a satellite image. If points of interest are enabled and the user is viewed as an authorized user with his or her location on the map
select buttons for the user and the POI overlay(s) are desplayed as well. The user overlay is displayed by default and users can add the POI overlay by
ticking this field. Unauthorized users may see the POI overlay by default if this is enabled by the administrator.  
User locations are displayed with circle markers coloured with the respective userÂ´s main group color and POIs are displayed with a triangle standing on its
point, coloured as the administrator has chosen during input.  
If more than one user selected the same combination of country and postal code all markers at this position would be overlapping entirely with only one user
visible. To prevent this the locations of the second and all subsequent users with identical country/postal code combinations are calculated with a dynamic
offset to spread them around the original position.
By clicking on a user marker a bubble will open which contains a link to this user's profile.
Clicking on a POI marker may open a bubble with additional information if this was supplied while creating this POI.
3.  Legend  
In this part the user groups are listed with their respective colour and the total number of Usermap users is displayed as well as the POI legend if these
are enabled.
  
If permitted users may create a new POI by right clicking into the map at the selected position (it is strongly recommended to zoom into the map prior to 
right clicking since it is far easier to select the desired spot on the big map). After this click a modal window is openend which shows a small map with
a very high zoom factor on the left side and on the right side a form to input a name and a description as well as dropdown fields to select the POI layer
and (or) the icon representing the POI (the default icon defined by the admin for the selected layer is pre-selected). The marker can be dragged with the
mouse to its final position; it is changed when selecting another layer or icon. If this is allowed in the board functionalities as well as in the post
settings it is possible to use BBCodes in the description textarea. Depending on those settings none of the BBCode buttons or the approbriate selection will
be displayed for usage.  
After submitting this form the POI data is stored in the data base and depending on the user's permission the new POI is either visible on the map or put
into the moderator queue. The user is informed which of these two actions has been taken. Moderators and administrators will - depending on their permissions
and notification settings - be notified that a new POI was created.
  
If a user has entered a valid combination of country code and postal code in the UCP this user's location will be displayed on the map. In addition there is a
link from the user's profile to this position on the map. Clicking on this link will open the map, center it on the user marker's position and zoom into the map.
  
#### *Administrator*
Administrators will find the `User Map` section within the ACP's `Extensions` tab providing itself five tabs:
1.  Settings  
	Please read the descriptions within the sections of this tab carefully since they provide vital information to the individual settings.  
	+  General Settings
		to define the number of rows to be displayed per page in the tables of the Internal database, POI handling and Map overlays tabs.
	+  Map Settings  
		to define latitude and longitude of the map's center when opening the Usermap window as well as the initial zoom (aka scale);
		in addition you can set the size of the marker used to display users' locations on the map independently for computers and for mobile devices.
	+  Username for geonames.org  
		should be self-explanatory; if no input was provided, the form keeps going back to this text field when hitting the `Submit` button. Please keep in
		mind that this setting MUST NOT be empty since geonames is the extensions primary means to get coordinates.  
		Usermap DOES NOT check the validity of the provided user name, this is wholly the administrator's responsibility!
	+  Settings for using Google Maps API  
		to provide the API key necessary for using this service. Please keep in mind that you need to activate this key for the `Geocoding API` to operate 
		properly.  
		If you enabled the Google Maps service without providing input in this text field the ACP will keep coming back to this field until you input a key.  
		As well as the input for the geonames user name this input is not checked for its validity!  
		Since Google Maps is for a number of countries more accurate than geonames.org you can additionally select countries by their two-letter country
		code to enforce the lookup in the Google Maps instead of the geonames.org data base.
	+  Using the internal database  
		The internal database (which has to be filled by the administrator, see serial 4. for further information) is kind of a last resort to gain coordinates
		for a given pair of country/postal code. You may want to use this possibility if only a few of your board's users live in countries not listed in the
		geonames database and you don't want to use the Google Maps API service.
	+  Display points of interest (POI)  
		Enabling the display of the POI overlay is done with this setting. **Enabling this setting is a prerequisite for all user permissions regarding POIs
		to be in force!**
	+  Default values for POI-Icons  
		This setting allows you to define your own default values for the POI icon size and anchor. Thus you can change the default setting of the icons
		delivered with Usermap (e.g. make them bigger or smaller) or set the values needed for your own icons in case you omitted the before mentioned icons
		and uploaded your own ones.
	+  POI Legend  
		This setting is only displayed if the POI overlay is enabled (see previous setting). You can enter a description of your POI's colour scheme or
		whatever you wish to say to your users about the POIs.
	
2.  Language packs  
	Usermap checks during installation the languages which are installed with your board and if there is a corresponding language pack in its language
	subdirectory it installs the necessary dropdown field for the country in this language. For all other languages this dropdown field is installed using
	the English language pack. If you later aquire an additional Usermap language pack or install an additional language (for which you have a Usermap
	language pack) you need to install this language to enable your users to see the country dropdown field in this language.  
	This is done through this tab. It shows three tables, the first one containing the Usermap language packs ready for installation, which is done by
	just clicking on the `Install` link in the last column.  
	The second table lists all languages which are installed in your board but are missing in the Usermap package and the third table lists for your
	convenience all Usermap language packs with no language installed in your board.
	
3.  Internal database  
	If you are in need of coordinates for a country unsupported by Geonames and Google Maps APIs you can build your own table to look up these locations.
	Usermap enters a new table into the database at its installation where you can store country and postal code of the location in question together
	with its coordinates. If a user selects this combination and you have enabled the use of the internal database in the settings tab Usermap will fetch
	the coordinates to store with this user's data from this table.  
	The content of the table containing all of your manually entered locations with their ISO two uppercase letter country code and postal code as well as
	the corresponding coordinates with latitude and longitude as decimal degrees (e.g. 52.589Â°) is displayed at this tab's top. In the options column you
	find a link to delete the selected entry in case you no longer need it.  
	Underneath that table you can input new and edit existing locations. Each combination of country and postal code must be unique, entering an already
	existing combination a second time will result in an error message, this input will be rejected.
	
4.  POI handling  
	A Point of Interest (POI) could be any landmark you wish to show to your users. Usermap stores them in a table entered into the database at installation.
	If you have enabled the display of POIs you need to enter the data somewhere, this is the place you are looking for.  
	As with the internal database this tab starts with a table displaying the current content of the database table. Every POI has a name which is displayed
	as a tool tip when the mouse pointer hovers over the icon, a description which is displayed in a popup bubble when the user clicks the icon, a map overlay
	on which it will be displayed and an icon file which holds the icon with which the POI is marked on the map and a pair of coordinates. 
	Inactive POIs are indicated by an orange background of this table row.
	Underneath this table you find a form to input new POIs or edit existing POIs. The input fields of this form are pretty selfexplanatory, please note
	that you can use bbcodes (including linking to external web sites) in the description text field.  
	You can select from the available map overlays the one you would like this POI to be displayed on. According to the selected map overlay the default icon
	is pre-selected in the POI icon select field.  
	Since the icons are scalable vector graphic (SVG) files it is possible for the administrator to build own graphics or acquire them from the internet.
	If the administrator would like to use additional or other icons (they must be stored in Usermap's `styles/all/theme/images/poi` directory) their size
	and anchor point (the coordinate with the upper left corner as 0,0 counting to the right and downwards within the icon which is centered on the map
	coordinates) must be defined. For this purpose there are two fields to input these settings. Since SVG is a scalable format you can even display indivual
	icons smaller or bigger than others.  
	Please refer to [Excursus on icons](./docs/ICONS.md) for more information about SVG marker icons and their usage.  
	For the convenience of the users who are using the icons shipped with Usermap the initial values for those icons are already pre-selected.  
	Please note that a **red background** of the cell displaying the map overlay of a POI signals that there is no valid overlay selected! In this case this POI
	can not be displayed, you would have to edit this POI and select an existing overlay.
  
5.	Map overlays  
	Usermap allows the administator to create as many map overlays as he/she feels necessary to present POIs to the board's users. This is done in this section.  
	This section first presents a table containing all existing map overlays, pre-installed is the default map overlay named "POIs". The table displays the name
	given to identify it to the administrator, whether it is active (can hold POIs) and whether it will be displayed permanently. The next column shows the
	language variables which will present this overlay to the users on the layer control element. Using language variables allows the administrator to take care
	of all the languages installed on the board and thus present the overlay to every user in his/her chosen language. The following column displays the default
	POI icon chosen to present POIs on this overlay.  
	In the section below the table the administrator can create a new or edit an existing overlay. 
	The "Overlay name" is only used to identify the overlay to the administrator, so feel free to enter what ever suits you best.  
	Every new overlay is activated by default, you can deactivate it, but be aware that deactivated overlays can not be selected while creating a new POI and
	they are not shown in the layer control element of the Usermap. Please keep in mind when deactivating an existing overlay that POIs assigned to a deactivated
	overlay will not be visible to your board members.  
	If you want to display this overlay permanently and from the start of Usermap select "Yes" for "Display permanently". If you select "No" (default) users
	have to select this overlay in the map's layer control element to see the POIs assigned to it.  
	"Language variables" is probably the most demanding input field on this tab. Prior to using it please check what languages are installed on your board and
	what ISO codes these languages use. Then enter each of these ISO Codes followed by a colon and an approbriate term describing this overlay in the respective
	language. Please note that you MUST enter a line with the English ISO code "en" since this is phpBB's default and fallback language. If you are not sure
	how to do this try to edit the pre-installed "POIs" overlay and take a look at how the language variables are defined there.  
	The icon visible in the dropdown field "Default icon" is the one which will be pre-selected in all windows where you or your board members can create a
	POI. You may select different icons for your different overlays, but please keep in mind that users can still select another icon, so please check whenever
	you or your moderators approve a user-created POI.
	
  
Please note that a basic check is done when you input something in the form fields of the ACP, e.g. the coordinates need a dot as decimal separator but in
countries using a comma as separator it is easy to forget this, Usermap checks for a comma and automatically changes it into a dot. Usermap checks most inputs
respectively and either corrects the input or rejects it by deleting your input in this form field.

### **Permissions**
#### *User permissions*
With ver 0.10.0 a permission system was introduced into Usermap. Most of these permissions deal with user permissions which you will find all together in a
new tab called `Usermap` in ACP's permissions setting. These settings are (in order of their appearance):
+	*Can create a new POI w/o approval*  
	If you want users to be able to create new POIs without any further control by a moderator, grant them this permission. The newly created POI is immediately
	visible on the map.  
	This permission overrides the following permission if both are granted.  
	By default the user role **`All Features`** does have this permission.
+	*Can create a new POI only with moderator approval*  
	If you want to have user created POIs being checked by a moderator before they become a permanent part of the data base (and thus being displayed on the
	map) you grant them this permission. Moderators will get a notification when a new POI has been created.
+	*Can always view the Usermap*  
	Users with this permission can always see the map and its user markers, even if they haven't provided their own location for display. Since they do not
	have one, they are not permitted to search for other users around their own location.  
	Be aware that this includes the display of links to user profiles! If you do not want these users to see user profiles through a Usermap link you are
	strongly advised to check and limit the permissions to view user profiles!  
	By default the user role **`All Features`** does have this permission.
+	*Can view the Usermap only if listed on the map*  
	Users granted this permission can see the map and use the user search around their own location if they provided the necessary data (country and postal
	code of their own location). If they have not provided their own (valid) data those users will still see a `You are not authorized to see the user map.`
	message.
+	*Can view POIs*  
	Users can view the POIs on the map after you granted them this permission. This permission is a prerequisit for users to be able to create POIs.  
	By default the user role **`All Features`** does have this permission.
  
Concerning permissions please keep in mind that
1.	users will see the link to the Usermap ONLY if they have one of the three *view* permissions mentioned above, e.g. if you grant the guest group the
	permission to view the POIs every guest can see and follow the link to the Usermap.
2.	all user permissions regarding POIs only apply when the display of POIs is enabled in the ACP and
3.	the two permissions regarding the creation of POIs by a user only apply if the user is permitted to see the POIs (if a user is not permitted to view the
	POIs it really doesn't make any sense to let him create a new one, does it)
  
#### *Administrator and Moderator permissions*
There is one permission each for administrators and moderators which you will find in the respective permission settings page under the `Misc` tab:
+	*Can manage the Usermap* for administrators.  
	This should be pretty self-explanatory, by default full administrators do have this permission.  
	To enable this permission Usermap's ACP tabs will be removed and re-added by two migration files during the enable process.
+	*Can approve user created POIs* for moderators.  
	You should give this permission to all moderator roles you wish to be able to see and approve POIs created by your users (if you enabled your users to
	create POIs which need approval before being displayed on the map). Since moderators had no role in Usermap until now this will work initially.  
	By default full moderators do have this permission.
	
  
### **Icons**
The usage of Usermap makes it necessary to be familiar with icons, especially if used as markers on a map and as SVG (Scalabale Vector Graphics) icons.
To keep this file as simple as possible please refer to [Excursus on icons](./docs/ICONS.md) for more information about SVG marker icons and their usage.
  
### **Requirements**

As mentioned above a (free) account with *[geonames.org][]* is mandatory and if you choose to additionally use Google Maps you need to set up an account
with the *[Google Maps API][]* as well, links are provided within the `ACP Settings` tab of Usermap.  
  
### **Tipps and tricks**
  
Starting with ver 1.1.0 Usermap can be used to place user markers as precise as a street address. But how to accomplish this task?  
The solution is twofold: Firstly the administator must enable the usage of the Google Maps API (see Usermap settings), get an API key and insert the two-letter-
countrycode of the country this should work for into the input field "Country code of those countries enforced to look up with Google Maps API". This ensures
that entries for the respective country will not be processed through the (default) Geonames database but through the Google Maps database which provides
coordinates down to street address level.
  
Secondly the users have to enter their address into phpBB's location profile field, they do have several choices:  
+	The user provides no input. In this case the marker for his/her location on the map is still very general (similar, but possibly not identical to the one 
	provided by Geonames).
+	The user provides just the name of the town/village he/she is living in. In this case the Google Maps database provides a coordinate to place the user
	marker a little bit more precisely on the respective town's coordinates.
+	The user provides a street name (if this name is not unique within the postal code area please provide the town name followed by space and the street name).
	In this case the Google Maps database provides a coordinate representing this street.
+	The user provides a fully qualified street address consisting of the town's name (if the street is not unique to the postal code area) and/or a street name
	and a house number (or whatever qualifies as a valid street address in the respective country). In this case the user marker will be placed on the rooftop
	of the house this user lives in.  
  
**Example:**  
The German postal code 34613 represents an area with two towns and several small villages. Using only the country code "DE" and the postal code wil produce
a coordinate somewhere in the vicinity of this area's center. Providing the town name "Treysa" in the location profile field will place the user marker in this
town's center. Providing the additional information of a street name, e.g. "Alsfelder Strasse" places the marker somewhere on this street. And providing the
street address "Treysa Alsfelder Strasse 27" will place the marker onto this house's rooftop (since "Alsfelder Strasse" is unique within this postal code area
entering just "Alsfelder Strasse 27" into the location profile field will result in an identical coordinate).
