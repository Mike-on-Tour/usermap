# Change Log
All changes to `Usermap for phpBB` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
  
## [0.8.0] - 2020-09-02
**Please note:** Due to switching from the (deprecated) usage of the `user` classes `lang` element to the `$language->lang` class methods Usermap completely
lost the (never intended anyway) backwards compatibility with phpBB 3.1.x and phpBB versions prior to version 3.2.6. This is the main reason for the minor
version increment otherwise it would only be a patch version increment.

### Added
-	A check for a closing '/' character in the `jsServerConfig` variable in `mot_usermap.js` to prevent double slashes which could lead to a read error
	when loading the POI marker files
-	Added an `if` clause in the ACP template `acp_usermap_main.html` to show POI legend settings only if POIs are enabled
-	Added a javascript function and a variable set by the calling ACP script to ACP templates `acp_usermap_main.html` and `acp_usermap_poi.html` to enable
	the windows to scroll to the approbiate form in case the `Edit` or `Preview` button was hit
-	`README.md` file
-	`CHANGELOG.md` file
-	`ext.php` file to check the phpBB version to prevent installation/enabling on boards with phpBB versions prior to 3.2.6

### Changed
-	All references to `$user->lang` have been replaced with `$language->lang`, Usermap is therefore not backwards compatible with phpBB 3.1.x (which it
	was never intended to anyway), files subject to this change are `controller/main.php`, `event/main_listener.php` and `config/services.yml`
-	Converted all `prosilver` templates to [TWIG](https://twig.symfony.com/) syntax
-	Replaced the use of php comparison operator `<>` with `!=` in all php files to adhere to phpBB coding guidelines
-	Changed the use of `sizeof()` to `count()` in all php files
-	Changed the use of double quotes inside the language strings to `Â´` in all language files 

### Fixed
-	Corrected typos in en language file
-	Corrected a typo in de language file
-	Fixed two possible SQL injections in `event/main_listener.php`
-	Changed a twice used name (once for the form and secondly for a textarea) in `adm/style/acp_usermap_main.html` by renaming the textarea from `mot_usermap_poi_legend`
	to `mot_usermap_poi_legend_text`
-	Inserted a check for inactive users in the function that is called when an administrator edits user profile data in `event/main_listener.php` to prevent
	inactive users being inserted into the USERMAP_USERS_TABLE prior to activation which will then cause a SQL error during activation (double primary key)

### Removed
-	Text file `version_history.txt`
-	`functions_user.php` was included in `controller/main.php` but not used -> removed


## [0.7.0] - 2020-06-29

### Added
-	New feature to show additional POI on the map
-	New table `usermap_poi` to store the data base input
-	New `config` variables `mot_usermap_poi_enable` and `mot_usermap_poi_showtoall` and new `config_text` variable `mot_usermap_poi_legend`
-	New migration file `v_0_7_0.php` 
-	New ACP tab to list and amend the internal POI data base

### Changed
-	Converted all ACP templates to [TWIG](https://twig.symfony.com/) syntax
-	javascript file `mot_usermap.js` is now included in the template files only, no longer within `acp_overall_footer_after.html` and thus to be included
	in ALL ACP templates
-	ACP template file `acp_usermap_body.html` renamed `acp_usermap_main.html` to fit to ACP module `main_module.php`
-	Changed line 361 in `main_listener.php` from `if ($user_colour !== '') . . .` to a ternary operator setting this value to either black (#000000) if the
	string is empty or leave the original value. Change was necessary due to unchanged colours if the `REGISTERED` group wasn't given a colour when the
	default group was changed (either by admin or by reaching the necessary number of posts to leave the `NEWLY_REGISTERED` group

### Fixed

### Removed
-	Subdirectory `mot/usermap/adm/style/event` and the template file `acp_overall_footer_after.html` within this subdirectory are removed

-	Changed the OSM map server to https instead of http

### Fixed
-	`controller/main.php`: Changed the test whether a user is part of the usermap in line 94 from `if (isset($row))` to `if (!empty($row))` because the
	updated sql query always sets $row but leaves it empty if no user row is found within the usermap_users table


## [0.6.1] - 2020-06-04

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
-	Corrected sql errors in migration file `v_0_6_0_0.php` which in combination with `language/en/countrycode.php` led to ajax and data base errors

	registration is needed

	and therefore no data could be acquired

## [0.4.0] - 2020-04-24

### Added
-	Event listener `core.acp_users_profile_modify_sql_ary` to `main_listener.php` in order to take care of changes made by the admin
	within the ACP profile tab of a user
-	Language files with the Country Code (two letter denominator, eg. DE) and the full name with all (currently) 250 countries in order to get rid of the
	former Custom Profile Field inherited from an old 3.0.x modification
-	Migration files `v_0_4_0_0.php` and `v_0_4_0_1.php` to create custom profile fields `mot_zip` and `mot_land`
-	New `config_text` variable `mot_usermap_countrycodes` to hold the 250 two uppercase letter country codes
-	Migration file `v_0_4_0_2.php` to fill the `config_text` variable `mot_usermap_countrycodes` from the language file

### Changed
-	Optimized sql queries in files `main.php` and `main_listener.php`
-	Leaflet from version 1.4 to version 1.6

### Fixed
-	Corrected errors from `serialize` and `unserialize` by changing to `json_encode` and `json_decode` respectively in the file `main_listener.php`
	for writing and reading `config` and `config_text` varaibles

### Removed
-	`config` variable `mot_usermap_countrycodes` since it won't be able to hold 250 new country codes due to structure (255 characters only)
