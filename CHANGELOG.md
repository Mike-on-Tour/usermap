### Added
-	A check for unwanted characters in POI names in `controller/main.php`, `controller/mod_poi.php` and `controller/mot_usermap_acp.php`
	including the definition of those characters in `includes/functions_usermap.php`
-	A new migration file `migrations/v_1_2_1.php` to change the length of the "name" field in the `USERMAP_POI_TABLE` from 50 to 60 characters and to change
	all existing POI names to a storage format using the `generate_text_for_storage()` function to prevent errors with old formats while using the BBCode to
	link to a POI

## [1.2.0] - 2022-07-20

### Added
-	The leaflet.markercluster class in order to enable clustering the markers if selected in the layer tab. A new settings option has been added to the layer
	tab to individually cluster markers for each layer.
	Affected files are `acp/layer_module.php`, `adm/style/acp_usermap_layer.html`, `adm/style/admin_mot_usermap.js`, `controller/main.php`,
	`styles/all/template/mot_usermap.js`, `styles/prosilver/template/usermap_main.html` and all `info_acp_mot_usermap.php` language files.
-	A new migration file `migrations/v_1_2_0_0.php` to add the new columns to the `usermap_layers` table for marker clusters, more layer types, layer_positions
	within the individual layer types and groups permitted to see the individual layers
-	Code to handle actions initialised by BBCodes to show a user, a POI or a location on Usermap
-	To the layers the ability within the individual layer types to have a position and to change those positions in the ACP in order to show them to the users
	in the sequence preferred by the admin
-	The property of groups permitted to see individual layers in order to enable admins to control what user groups can see individual layers if the group
	permissions permit seeing the map (members) and/or POIs
-	An overlay selection field to reduce the number of listed POIs to one or all overlays.
-	A copyright in the overall footer if Usermap is displayed
-	A loading image to be displayed in the searches
-	A Dutch language pack

-	The minimum PHP version required to run Usermap is now set to PHP 7.2
-	The map div height from fixed 600px to the screen height minus 50 pixels in order to use the full screen height for the map
-	The ACP modules to one ACP module and one info file for it in order to enable a new controller file (`controller/mot_usermap_acp.php`), this made
	necessary two new migration files (`migrations/v_1_2_0_1.php` and `migrations/v_1_2_0_2.php`) to remove the old modules and insert the new modules
-	The names of ACP HTML files to a common prefix of `acp_mot_usermap_` followed by the mode name

	of 8 characters but including a dash (e.g. Brasilian postal codes like 68721-000) and thus exceeding the maximum column length

### Fixed
-	A possible source for a bad HTML request because of address string wasn't properly URL encoded in `event/main_listener.php`, line 650

	`styles/prosilver/template/usermap_poi_input_bbcode.html`
-	`composer.json` and `README.md` to show new version number

### Fixed
-	A wrong path to the English countrycode file in `migrations/v_0_6_0_0.php`
-	Undefined permissions variables to hand over to javascript in `styles/prosilver/template/usermap_main.html` due to defining them in the wrong if-clause

	variable, affected files are `controller/main.php` and `styles/all/template/mot_usermap.js`
-	The ACP tab to handle POIs, the modal window to create POIs and the moderator page to approve/deny user-created POIs now contain a dropdown field to select

	Affected files are `acp/poi_module.php` and `adm/style/acp_usermap_poi.html`
-	Use PHP's `file` command instead of `fopen()`, `fgets()` and `fclose()` functions to read the countrycode files in `acp/lang_module.php` and
	`migrations/v_0_4_0_1.php` files (first implemented with `migrations/v_0_10_0_4.php`)
-	The check for valid geonames.org usernames by allowing dots in usernames (until now a dot was assumed to be a "misplaced" comma and was exchanged
	accordingly), affected file is `adm/style/admin_mot_usermap.js`

### Fixed
-	Added a missing paragraph end tag in `adm/style/acp_usermap_poi.html`, line 143 (new line 144)
-	Wrong entries in the fr `countrycode.php` file (CU was 'Serbie et Montenegro' instead of 'Cuba' which was shifted one line down as well as all
	entries until CX which was 'Curaçao' instead of the missing 'Île Christmas'.

## [0.9.2] - 2020-12-01

### Added
-	French language pack

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed
  
  
## [0.9.1] - 2020-10-29

### Added
	
### Changed
	
### Fixed
-	Faulty SQL query in `event/main_listener.php`, line 390 which led to an undesired result (ALL users got selected and the first to be processed was
	the anonymous [guest] user).
	
### Removed

  
## [0.9.0] - 2020-10-26
**Please note:** Due to changes regarding the `$language` variable in the ACP files Usermap is now compatible with ALL versions of phpBB 3.2.x and 3.3.x!

### Added
-	A check for the user agent to enable two settings for marker sizes (mobile devices and all other) in `style/all/template/mot_usermap.js`
-	Two new settings to allow the admin to define the radius of the markers showing user locations on the map, one for PCs, laptops, notebooks, netbooks etc.
	and one for mobile devices. Affected files are `acp/main_module.php`, `adm/style/acp_usermap_main.html`, `controller/main.php`,
	`styles/all/template/mot_usermap.js` and all language files.
-	The facility to define the size and the anchor of POI icons in order to better generate user defined icons or to set size and anchor point of individual
	icons. Affected files are `acp/poi_module.php`, `adm/style/acp_usermap_poi.html`, `adm/style/admin_mot_usermap.js`, `styles/all/template/mot_usermap.js`
	and all language files.
-	Two new migration files, `v_0_9_0_0` to add the new config variables for marker sizes and the two additional columns in the `phpbb_usermap_poi` table
	and `v_0_9_0_1` to fill those new columns with the so far static values for all icons delivered with Usermap
	
### Changed
-	Leaflet from version 1.6 to version 1.7.1
-	If a POI has no description `styles/all/template/mot_usermap.js` will no longer open an empty popup window.
-	In the files `acp/database_module.php`, `acp/lang_module.php`, `acp/main_module.php` and `acp/poi_module.php` the global variable `$language` was used.
	Since this global variable was introduced in phpBB 3.2.6 with Usermap 0.8.0 an `ext.php` file was added to prevent installation on phpBB version 3.2.5
	and earlier. In Usermap 0.9.0 the variable `$language` is no longer acquired from the global variable but instead from the `phpbb_container` where it
	was introduced with phpBB 3.2.0. So the four ACP files are changed accordingly and the `ext.php` file checks now for phpBB versions later or equal to
	3.2.0.
-	The `README.md` file according to the new features.

### Fixed
-	Quick links and user dropdown menus are partially hidden by the Usermap's map object due to high numbers for z-index for several leaflet elements
	(as high as 1000). Solved by assigning a z-index of 1024 to phpBB's `.dropdown` class in `styles/prosilver/theme/usermap.css`
-	In answering some reports of SQL errors with `user_id` and `username` set to NULL whilst writing new users to the `usermap_users` table after
	editing user profiles in the ACP or UCP it is now checked whether this user is already in the `profile_fields_data` table in the `event/main_listener.php`
	files `process_user_profile_data` function; if he is not then no data from this table is queried to prevent an empty result (and thus NULL values for
	`user_id` and `username`.

### Removed
-	An unnecessary check for BOTs while building the user group list in `controller/main.php`


## [0.8.0] - 2020-09-02
**Please note:** Due to switching from the (deprecated) usage of the `user` classes `lang` element to the `$language->lang` class methods Usermap completely
lost the (never intended anyway) backwards compatibility with phpBB 3.1.x and phpBB versions prior to version 3.2.6. This is the main reason for the minor
version increment otherwise it would only be a patch version increment.

### Added
-	A check for a closing '/' character in the `jsServerConfig` variable in `mot_usermap.js` to prevent double slashes which could lead to a read error
	when loading the POI marker files
-	Added an `if` clause in the ACP template `acp_usermap_main.html` to show POI legend settings only if POIs are enabled
-	Added a javascript function and a variable set by the calling ACP script to ACP templates `acp_usermap_main.html` and `acp_usermap_poi.html` to enable
	the windows to scroll to the approbiate form in case the `Edit` or `Preview` button was hit
-	`README.md` file
-	`CHANGELOG.md` file
-	`ext.php` file to check the phpBB version to prevent installation/enabling on boards with phpBB versions prior to 3.2.6

### Changed
-	All references to `$user->lang` have been replaced with `$language->lang`, Usermap is therefore not backwards compatible with phpBB 3.1.x (which it
	was never intended to anyway), files subject to this change are `controller/main.php`, `event/main_listener.php` and `config/services.yml`
-	Converted all `prosilver` templates to [TWIG](https://twig.symfony.com/) syntax
-	Replaced the use of php comparison operator `<>` with `!=` in all php files to adhere to phpBB coding guidelines
-	Changed the use of `sizeof()` to `count()` in all php files
-	Changed the use of double quotes inside the language strings to `´` in all language files 

### Fixed
-	Corrected typos in en language file
-	Corrected a typo in de language file
-	Fixed two possible SQL injections in `event/main_listener.php`
-	Changed a twice used name (once for the form and secondly for a textarea) in `adm/style/acp_usermap_main.html` by renaming the textarea from `mot_usermap_poi_legend`
	to `mot_usermap_poi_legend_text`
-	Inserted a check for inactive users in the function that is called when an administrator edits user profile data in `event/main_listener.php` to prevent
	inactive users being inserted into the USERMAP_USERS_TABLE prior to activation which will then cause a SQL error during activation (double primary key)

### Removed
-	Text file `version_history.txt`
-	`functions_user.php` was included in `controller/main.php` but not used -> removed


## [0.7.0] - 2020-06-29

### Added
-	New feature to show additional POI on the map
-	New table `usermap_poi` to store the data base input
-	New `config` variables `mot_usermap_poi_enable` and `mot_usermap_poi_showtoall` and new `config_text` variable `mot_usermap_poi_legend`
-	New migration file `v_0_7_0.php` 
-	New ACP tab to list and amend the internal POI data base

### Changed
-	Converted all ACP templates to [TWIG](https://twig.symfony.com/) syntax
-	javascript file `mot_usermap.js` is now included in the template files only, no longer within `acp_overall_footer_after.html` and thus to be included
	in ALL ACP templates
-	ACP template file `acp_usermap_body.html` renamed `acp_usermap_main.html` to fit to ACP module `main_module.php`
-	Changed line 361 in `main_listener.php` from `if ($user_colour !== '') . . .` to a ternary operator setting this value to either black (#000000) if the
	string is empty or leave the original value. Change was necessary due to unchanged colours if the `REGISTERED` group wasn't given a colour when the
	default group was changed (either by admin or by reaching the necessary number of posts to leave the `NEWLY_REGISTERED` group

### Fixed

### Fixed
-	`controller/main.php`: Changed the test whether a user is part of the usermap in line 94 from `if (isset($row))` to `if (!empty($row))` because the

	within the ACP profile tab of a user

	former Custom Profile Field inherited from an old 3.0.x modification

	for writing and reading `config` and `config_text` varaibles
